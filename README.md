# GD-1.0-Decompiled
A Decompilation of the very first version of geometry dash

## Motivation
- I discovered that it might be a smarter idea to decompile the first version of the game rather than tackling later versions of the game first,
this way when each version of the game gets fully decompiled later versions of geometry dash will be easier to solve. This will take longer but it has it's
has long term benefits overall.
- libgame.so is smaller than libcocos2d.so (2.2074) by almost half the size and it has less functions that need solving.
- We have a higher chance of a version of Geometry dash being fully decompiled than none at all and that's saying something.

## FYI
- I do not condone piracy of the game however I do believe in being able to recompile the game when it's been fully decompiled.
This is why I am not handing out game assets. If you want those, buy the game.

## Current Tasks
- [pending...] find all Class members and name them all off 100% (excluding cocos2d stuff and other unimportant things) 
- [] write C++ code when all class members have been found and named off....
